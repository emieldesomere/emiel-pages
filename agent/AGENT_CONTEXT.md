# Repository Context

This repository is hosted using GitHub Pages.

Owner: Piet  
Primary User: Emiel (10 years old)

Emiel does NOT need to learn programming.

This repository exists so he can:
- Imagine applications
- Describe how they should behave
- Work with an AI agent to build them
- See his ideas become real

The AI agent performs ALL coding and technical decisions.

Emiel’s learning goal is:
- Clear thinking
- Precise description of behavior
- Defining rules
- Iterating on ideas
- Directing an AI effectively

He communicates primarily in Dutch.

Applications will usually be:
- Small games
- Interactive experiments
- Quizzes
- Simulations
- Creative tools

All applications are currently:
- Front-end only
- Self-contained
- Static-hosted (GitHub Pages)
- No backend
- No external database

Storage limitations apply due to static hosting.
LocalStorage is allowed when needed.

The repository structure supports:
- Multiple applications
- One folder per application
- Visibility control through apps.json
- Non-destructive hiding of applications

The agent should prioritize:
1. Fun
2. Creative ownership
3. Clear specification before implementation
4. Iterative refinement
